# My Journey into Computer Science: CS50x Week 0 🚀

I am thrilled to share my very first project for Harvard University's *CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science*! This marks the beginning of an exciting learning path.

## 🕹️ About the Project
For "Week 0", I developed a simple yet fun interactive game using *Scratch*. Although it's a basic project, it was a great way to dive into:
* *Logic & Problem Solving*: Thinking like a programmer.
* *Control Flow*: Using loops and conditional statements.
* *Creativity*: Designing sprites and interactive elements.

## 🎯 My Goals
I am incredibly motivated to complete the upcoming weeks and tackle the challenges of C, Python, and SQL. My ultimate goal is to master these fundamentals and earn my *CS50 Certificate*! 🎓
